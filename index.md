The Learning Salon: Sept. 4, 4 pm Eastern, https://www.crowdcast.io/e/learningsalon/1
Also livecast to YouTube

We are pleased to invite you to be our guest on The Learning Salon, hosted by Joshua, Ida and John. The Learning Salon is an intellectual gathering where we explore contentions and bridges between biological and artificial learning. Each week we invite a guest to help us uncover core questions that lurk underneath the overwhelming proliferation of approaches to learning and intelligence. 

We envisage a salon that will bring together diverse disciplines and individuals to discuss, debate, and advance the prospects for advancing our fields. We welcome and anticipate ideas and discussions with a wide scope, spanning from machine learning and artificial intelligence to computational, behavioral, and cognitive neuroscience, psychology and cognitive science, and philosophy. 
 
We aim for diversity in discussions: in terms of perspective, background, and identity. Our goal is to create an atmosphere that encourages vigorous debate while avoiding unnecessary competitiveness; the goal is to learn, not to be correct over outsmarting others. All questions are encouraged and should be answered with respect.
 
We invite speakers to couch their 15-20 minute presentations in terms of what they regard core questions in learning and intelligence. We discourage standard technical talks that are aimed at a small subset of colleagues in the same subfield. The presentation will be followed by a panel discussion and Q & A. 

We invite attendants to submit their questions during the talks or email us their questions up to a week prior to a given talk at jovo@progl.ai.

 
We look forward to learning with you, 
The Learning Salon
