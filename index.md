Welcome to the hub for Transmedia Progressive Learning research!

Transmedia: across learning agents (i.e. both machine learning and biological learning)

Progressive Learning: "agents learn progressively whenever they leverage data to 
improve performance on both previously met, and as yet unmet tasks, with resource constraints" [1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12908)
