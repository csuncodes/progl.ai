Welcome to the hub for Transmedia Progressive Learning research!

Transmedia: across learning agents (i.e. both machine learning and biological learning)

Progressive Learning: "agents learn progressively whenever they leverage data to 
improve performance on both previously met, and as yet unmet tasks, with resource constraints" [1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12908) 

## Weekly Seminar Series
Starting 7/29/2020, a seminar series will be held weekly on Wednesdays at noon ET. More details TBA.

## Progressive Learning for ML

## Core References

## Core Collaborators
More details TBA.


### This initiative is coordinated by the NeuroData lab at Johns Hopkins University.
